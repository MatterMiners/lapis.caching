Caching extension for LAPIS simulator

## Installation

LAPIS.Caching is currently in development stage.
To setup the package and contribute please ensure to

* clone this repository.

Further, we use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) to properly
setup the namespace dependency with
[LAPIS](https://github.com/MatterMiners/lapis).
So please ensure to set your working directory to the just
cloned repository and install the appropriate dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```
