summary: "Jobs execution within drones"
description: |
  Until now jobs have been started implictly by the scheduler within its scheduling
  cycle. This created some issues for asynchronous tasks within jobs as those were
  bound to the duration of the scheduling cycle. Therefore, we introduced a new
  queue within drones that receive the jobs from the scheduler. Further, the drone
  now takes care to properly start the job so that it runs independently now in
  the scope of the drone.
