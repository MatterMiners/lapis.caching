summary: "Importing of SWF files"
description: |
  SWF imports did not properly do the unit conversion but instead accessed a
  wrong dictionary to get the conversion information. Now they use the correct
  dictionary.
  Further, SWF defines values of ``-1`` as a default for user values that have
  not been specified. However, negative values of resources in LAPIS are not
  supported. Therefore, negative values now default to ``0`` in import process.ÃŸ
