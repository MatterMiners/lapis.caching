summary: "Update of available resources during scheduling cycle"
description: |
  Until now jobs took care on updating available resources after a job was
  started resulting in an adaption of the auto clustering in the scheduler.
  As the starting of jobs took longer than the scheduling within one scheduling
  cycle another job could be assigned although the resources were gone already.
  This is fixed now by temporarily assuming resource allocation after a job was
  sent to a drone within the scheduler itself.
