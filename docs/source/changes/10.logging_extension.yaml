summary: "Extension of logging"
description: |
  The logging of predefined logging functions now follows a specified database
  structure. The structure is documented in the documentation of the package.
  Further, the logging was extended to additionally support logging to telegraf
  using the python default UDP logging port and the LineProtocolFormat of telegraf.
  The timestamps of the log messages follow the simulation time.
