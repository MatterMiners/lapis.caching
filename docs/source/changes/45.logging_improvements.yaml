summary: "Object-based logging and logging for job events"
description: |
  So far the logging during simulation was flag-based. A soon as the logging flag
  was set to ``True``, the logging process started. This created a lot of overhead.
  The logging now is object-based, meaning that only objects with relevant changes
  for logging are added to a logging queue. Each of those objects in the logging
  queue are processed by registered logging functions.

  Further, now also the logging of job events is supported through this global
  logging process.
