summary: "Proper termination of simulation"
description: |
  usim defines non-volatile and volatile running of async tasks within scopes.
  Volatile tasks can be finished by the outer scope when the outer scope
  terminates while non-volatile tasks must be finished before leaving the scope.
  So far, all tasks were run as non-volatile in lapis resulting in simulations
  that never finished as ``pools``, and ``controllers`` for example were running
  forever. This is fixed now by starting those tasks as volatile when running
  a simulation.
