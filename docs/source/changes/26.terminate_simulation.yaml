summary: "Termination of simulation"
description: |
  The scheduler so far did not have any information about when the simulation
  was expected to terminate. Therefore, a new property `_collecting` was introduced
  in the simlulator. This property is bound to the job queue. As soon as the
  job generator does not produce any new jobs the job queue is closed and after
  all jobs were removed, the property `_collecting` is set to `False` to
  initiate termination of simulation.
